# Graph

There are several ways to save Graph Structure:
* Eagle List: Use array to record every edge
* Adjacency Matrix: Use matrix to record the weights of every two vertexs
* Adjacency List: Every vertex maps to a list of connected vertexs.

Algorithms:
* Union-find algorithm: How to find groups in the graph
* Find the shortest path:
